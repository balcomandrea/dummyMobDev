							&emsp;&emsp;Corn is the second major crop in the Philippines next to rice where most of Filipino farmers depend as their source of living. Farmers choose varieties of corn for both household and commercial usage. Hybrid varieties are common choices of farmers when it comes to commercial and purely income purposes. Hence, with proper and effective corn management, corn farmers are mindful of the mount of yield to be expected at the end of its harvest.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;Insect pest infestation is the primary problem of corn farmers since it has an effect on the number of yield. Identifying its damage pattern on corn leaf is a very challenging and difficult task for farmers since they had limited capability and resources. They can only describe the damage through naked eye, thus they do not know what exactly the insect is. As a result, they tend to generalize insects and apply different varieties of chemical insecticides which compromise the quality and nutrients found on soil.

							&emsp;&emsp;Kitkit App is a mobile application that applies Digital Image processing in identifying damage pattern on corn leaf that will determine possible insect pest. The process starts when the user runs the installed Kitkit App application on his Android smartphone. Kitkit App captures the damage pattern on corn leaf using the smartphone’s camera. The captured damage pattern is processed through keypoints algorithm for matching with the datasets. Keypoints of the captured image is compared with keypoints of datasets using Brute-Force matcher algorithm. As comparing and matching process is done. Kitkit App displays the possible insect pests that infested the corn leaf. Its description about the insect is provided and more information such as control measures as well as other plants being affected is also given. The user can also view the real-time location where the application takes place through Geotagging which is also a feature of the KitkitApp.

							&emsp;&emsp;Researchers searched and studied multiple related literature of the components used in the system as well as related systems to identify the similarities and differences of the developed system. Moreover, the researchers used the Modified Waterfall as a Development Model to enable the researchers go back to its development phase whenever the application fails in the testing phase.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;Kitkit App is an Android application that will identify damage pattern of insect pests on corn leaf through Digital Image Processing.

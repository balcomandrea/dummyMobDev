							&emsp;&emsp;It is a great thing to have an effective way of communication . We have a lot of ways to communicate, through talking, sign languages, and other possible ways. But when we talk about babies, they have their own way of communicating with adults even when they still do not know how to speak. It is their cry. It has been identified that the baby might be at risk if the caretaker does not respond to what the baby wants. The researchers found out that babies, between zero to three months old, have only five crying patterns. It is already been identified by Priscilla Dunstan and introduced to Oprah Winfrey show. The researchers conducted this study with the main goal of introducing it to the public and encouraging them to use it. In doing so, the researchers made a system that interprets the baby’s cry.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The system was designed to record the baby’s cry and store it as the input. The system effectively removes the background and white noises then calculates the pitch. The system also provides interpretation of the baby’s cry that will be used by the baby’s caretaker for responding to the needs of the baby.

							&emsp;&emsp;However, this study was focused more on audio processing which includes removing audio noises, calculate pitch, determining phonemes and also interpreting the baby’s language. The researchers recommend further study that may be conducted which includes the use of Android Mobile phones or tablets for easier use and access.

							&emsp;&emsp;Communication is one of the most essential things in life that one must learn. To understand and to be understood is the best way in knowing one’s side. For some people, the effective means of communicating to others is through writing. Through writing, they can express their knowledge to others. However, in case of some people especially those who are born blind or have lost their sense of vision early in life, they use Braille as their means of writing of writing. Braille system is composed of embossed dots that correspond to a letter.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;To understand what the visually impaired person has written, the proponents created an application, Braille App. A real-time, Transcription System, Braille App translates Braille characters into English text. This is intended for the normal sighted people to understand what the partially impaired person has written.

							&emsp;&emsp;Braille App translates Braille characters into English text while the user captures a video of Braille. The processing is rel-time to reduce the length of time in conversion and to provide less effort of transcribing large documents into English text.
							<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;Braille App is an Android application that works in Android 4.3 version and higher. The developers used OpenCV for the threshold process of the captured frame. This will undergo Braille Alphabet Extraction Algorithm for the translation of Braille dots into its corresponding English letter.
							<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;As the result, the Braille App application was able to provide real-time transcription of Braille document written in Swell Braille Font, generated a letter translation of Braille alphabet to English character using Open Compute Vision (OpenCV), and provided a text file format of the translated Braille characters.

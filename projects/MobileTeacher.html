							&emsp;&emsp;Technology advancement influenced the digital native’s learning styles resulting to the introduction of educational technologies such as mobile learning. It is any service or facility that delivers information and educational content to learners, aiding their acquisition of knowledge regardless of location and time. MobileTeacher: a Mobile Learning System is developed to help teachers and students to have accessible and interactive learning environment. Composed of Android and Web-Based applications, MobileTeacher allows students to study at their own time using their mobile devices and also gives teachers a platform to create the lecture materials using desktop computers or an Android device.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;MobileTeacher was implemented using the Modified Rapid Application Development as the software development process. The three different applications were developed concurrently that has been integrated and tested t the final stage of development. The Android application has two forms: the student’s and the teacher’s versions. The student’s Android application allows students to take online quizzes and read lecture materials offline. On the other hand, the teacher’s Android application enables teachers to edit, delete, and preview functionalities of the mobile version. The Web-based application is designed for desktop web-browsers while the Android apps are designed for Android operating system version 4.0 Ice Cream and above.

							&emsp;&emsp;The offline features of the Android applications are done by synchronizing the content from the Web server with the Android’s local database. The Android services detects whether the internet connectivity state is changed to start the background thread that sends the HTTP request to the server. The server returns a JSON formatted data to be parsed on the Android inner database. This functionality lessens the burden of downloading lecture materials uploaded by teachers.

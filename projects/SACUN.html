							&emsp;&emsp;Through the customization of the adapted third party software Virtual Spirit, the Ask-a-Librarian Instant Messaging system was created via an instant messaging with an instant messages that are sent by clients to the reference librarian. The Virtual Spirit supports both live chat and automated chat. Te identified FAQs were encoded in a database as stored information.

							&emsp;&emsp;It is recommended that a system of a similar nature be developed from scratch without using third party software for full customization in response to the growing and changing needs of the library clients.

							&emsp;&emsp;Most academic institutions may require students to submit source codes produced as part of an exercise to monitor how well their students understand the material taught on the module. The submitted source codes maybe checked by instructors for similarities in order to identify instances of source code copying. Considering this information, a system that detects similarities between source codes must be implemented. The researchers conducted a study entitled, “Source-code Similarities Detection Using Greedy String Tiling Algorithm for C and C++”. It is a desktop application that detects and classifies similarities among source codes submitted by novice students. The application was created using Java programming language<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The study aimed to help the Programming 1 instructors of the University of Southeastern Philippines Institute of Computing in reducing the time it takes in checking the source codes submitted by their students. The study also intends to encourage students to develop their own programming skills.<br><br></div>

							&emsp;&emsp;The objective of this study is to import all stored source files written in C and C++ from the folder/directory where files were saved for program analysis: to compare all source files using the different algorithms used by the researchers such as Greedy String Tiling tiling,Word or Statement Matching Algorithm, Source Line Matching algorithm and Semantic Sequence algorithm to identify program similarities, and provide statistical information as well as the similar submitted source codes.

							&emsp;&emsp;In developing the system, the researchers used JFreeChart, an open source library that allows users to easily generate graphs and charts JDK 1.6 and NetBeans IDE for the coding of the system. The input-Process Output (IPO) model was used in the development of the application.
							<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The researchers had achieved their goal to create an application that can import all stored source codes written in C and C++ and detect the similarities. Moreover, the application can detect programming constructs such as basic inputs and output, variable declaration and date types, constants and literals, logical and arithmetic operators, selective structure(switch statement), conditional structures and decision making (if, if else), repetition (for, while, do-while, arrays, functions, pointers, continue, break, go-to statements and file handling).
							<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The application has achieved its objectives and it available for modifications and improvements for future researchers.

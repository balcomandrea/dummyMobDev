							&emsp;&emsp;Music sheet is defined as a handwritten or printed form of music notation. Artistic people who love music like composers and singers are those that consider music sheets relevant and useful. Most ordinary music lovers who do not receive any formal training in music, however are not immediately the kind of music produced by this musical sheets. This motivated the researchers to develop a mobile Optical Music Recognition (OMR) system that will convert music sheets which will be used to convert music sheets into Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) format.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The main objective of this study was to come up with two versions: the Android-based mobile version and the Web Version, both with the capability of detecting, segmenting and recognizing images of musical symbols derive from a music sheet which will be used to convert into MIDI format for audio playback.
							<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The methodically used was an iterative and incremental development model which consists of several phases. The mobile application started capturing an image of a musical symbol image detection. Levels 0,1 , and 2 were used for segmenting stave lines and other musical symbols and Neural Network algorithm was used for recognition part and the MIDI conversion. The mobile version was just an add-on feature as it can only detect quarter notes in a single stave line.

							&emsp;&emsp;In the Web Application, scanned music sheets are to be uploaded to the Web. It the used Open Operation Algorithm for detection, Note Head detection for segmentation, and MatLab structure matrix for recognition and detection into MIDI format. The Web version can detect whole, half, quarter, and eight notes in G-Clef and Bass-Clef staff.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;The researchers recommended further implementations particularlyin the enhancement of the algorithm.

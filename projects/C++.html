							&emsp;&emsp;Tutorials are one of the best tools where people rely in understanding some difficult task. With the proper help of the tutorial, difficult information can be understood easily, In fact, throughout the web, many tutorials have been made already to help people understand or provide answers to their problems and difficulties. Some of these tutorials are to tech topics that are discussed in schools to help and support students and other individuals to cope and comprehend with their subjects.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;C++ Programming Interactive Tutorial via Visualization is a mobile Android application that teaches the basics of C++ Programming Language. This mobile application is an interactive tutorial for C++ Programming Language that provides visualization with the use of animation. C++ Programming Interactive Tutorial via Visualization tends to help those people who are beginners in programming, especially those Information Technology and Computer Science students, learn the basics of C++ Programming Language. The system also includes a test bank where all questions for the assessment feature of this project are stored. The application was designed to be user friendly, concise and direct for the user to understand immediately. It is also intuitive enough to avoid confusion to the user and can be easily comprehended by the different kinds of user.

							&emsp;&emsp;The developers also researched and studied various related literature about the components used in the system as well as related systems to distinguish the similarities and differences of the developed system. The developers also studied and stipulated in the documentation all the technologies that were used in the system. During the course of the development, the developers used the AndEngine framework as it supports multiple screen display and animation which makes it more compact, thereby reducing the file size of the application. The developers were able to achieve its objective by providing discussion to basic C++ programming lessons using animations, supporting each topic with interactive examples using drag and drop functionality; and providing assessments with randomized questions stored in a test bank to test the knowledge and understanding of the user in the selected C++ topics answered. The questions are equally divided by 3 category level namely: easy, average, and difficult. The results obtained from achieving the objects led to the completed application called C++ Programming Interactive Tutorial via Visualization.

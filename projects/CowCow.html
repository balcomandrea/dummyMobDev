							&emsp;&emsp;Meats is one of the nature’s most balanced foods and is filled with the things that our body needs to build and maintain muscle, gain strength, vitality and power us through our busy days. In fact, meat is a source of iron and Vitamin B12. Example varieties of meat are carabao and cow that, according to research and from the meat inspector of NMIS, there were instances that the meat vendors pass carabao meat (carabeef) as cow meat (beef). Due to this problem, vendors now tend to deceive consumers since carabeef is much cheaper as compares to beef.<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Last January 29, 2011, the National Meat Inspection Service released an article that warned suppliers against carabeef since there is no stopping some sellers passing off carabeef as beef. The reason why people cannot easily distinguish the difference between cow and carabao meat is because study shows that these meats have more similarities than differences. This is possible because carabeef resembles beef in texture and more likely to be similar in meat color. According to studies, in differentiating beef and carabeef, it needs a systematic rapid test. But if we are good at ocular and tactile identification of carabao meat, people would be able to distinguish it. But if they are not used to it, how can they distinguish beef from carabeef? The team’s solution for this is by using Cow&sup2; d’Carabao.

							&emsp;&emsp;Cow&sup2; d’Carabao is a mobile application that would help meat buyers identify if the meat they are buying is beef or carabeef, and it would enable the users to tag and comment on the location of a market place. Upon successful image processing, the application would be very helpful to meat buyers not to be deceive by meat vendors. Since it is portable, they can easily use it.
							The identification is based on the color and texture of the meats that can be differentiated through the rough texture and darker meat of the carabeef and the smooth tecxture and lighter color of the beef. This can be made possible by the use of the OpenCV; Open CV is a library of the programming functions that mainly aimed at real time image processing. Through these functions, the application can detect color and segment texture of the meats. The developers have studied and searched the qualities of the meats to be identified for the efficiency of the application.<br><br>

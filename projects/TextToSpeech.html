							&emsp;&emsp;Communication is composed of different kinds of methods, such as words, voice of tone and non-verbal forms. Sign language is the primary means of communication in the deaf community. Like any other languages, it also has grammar and vocabulary but uses visual modality for exchanging information. The sign language is a language that uses signs to communicate instead of sound. It has three major components and these are arms or body, facial expressions or movements of the lips. In finger-spelling, there is a corresponding sign for each letter of the alphabet. This type of communication is used mainly for spelling names. In word level sign vocabulary, there is a corresponding sign for each word of the vocabulary.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The system was designed to accept a video file that contains the symbols of finger-spelling gestures and basic expression of hand gestures. The system effectively detected the finger-spelling symbols for the letters of the English alphabet except for ‘j’ and ‘z. Similarly, the system effectively detected five symbols of basic expression of the hand gesture like please, sorry, hello, thank you and you’re welcome.the system have successfully segmented the symbols from one another by using horizontal and vertical projections algorithms. The system recognized and and converted the symbols into text by using template matching algorithm that gives almost 85 percent of recognition rate on the symbols that had the size of higher than 70 points. Lastly, the system successfully translated the recognized text into digital sound.

							&emsp;&emsp;However, this study was focused on detecting, segmenting, converting the finger-spelling symbols and basic hand expression from a video file, and it was limited to converting the text one word at a time. The researchers recommended further study that could enable the conversion of symbols using a more complicated real-time input.

							&emsp;&emsp;Internet is certainly one of the most important discoveries in the history of mankind. With it, people can do so many things. A particular stuff people can do using the power of of Internet is to create connections with other people from different places. This is apparent with the emergence of different social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Social networks are becoming unique touch points to engage communities, start conversations, recruit skillful employees, and develop new innovative ideas. Technologies’ considerable evolution has created a major impact to the change and advancement of the society.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;The availability of online platforms intended for drawing and sketching with social media capabilities is still on its childhood stage. There are numerous websites on the internet that allows all users to sketch and draw but are only limited to that. Users do not have the capability to share and post their works online to let other people see it and provide feedbacks. That is the reason why the project team developed DrawLots.

							&emsp;&emsp;DrawLots is a Web-based application that put emphasis on drawing and sketching. The project was tailored from the idea of creating a Web-Based counterpart of stand-alone applications such as MS Paint and Adobe Photoshop wherein people could easily share their artworks online. DrawLots provide a solution regarding an innovative way of drawing in a digital art and posting their artworks in one site. Since the project’s primary focus is on drawing and sketching, a drawing canvas with some of the most used drawing tool is provided. This projects also allows users to interact with their fellow users with the help of its discussion forum. Both the components of this project (canvas with drawing tools and discussion forum) is powered by third party application namely Literally Canvas and PhpBB respectively.

							&emsp;&emsp;The project team searched and studied multiple related literature of the components used in the system as well as related system to identify similarities and differences of the developed system. In addition, the project team made an Operational methodology that the project team made was based on the iterative development model. It was used for the development of DrawLots website since it gave the project tem the chance to reiterate the development process due to limited amount of time.

							&emsp;&emsp;Filipino children re vigorously coming in a bunch. This is most obvious in the type of games they play. We can always hear their warm laughter as they indulge in any of these games.<br><br>

							&emsp;&emsp;In Philippine society, native games are creating an important part of growing up. Some games are challenging; some are daring; some are using physical; some re intellectually stimulating. However, we play games though as a group or a team, games teach us sportsmanship. We enjoyed playing those games for many years , we didn’t need any referees or umpire to officiate between us but we still laugh, despite of an obvious inequality. When one loses in some games, the winners make you suffer some type of consequence, such as losing a turn; being punished; or being made to do certain tasks (e.g., errands). Some games make you win prizes. But win or lose, in totality, we get enjoyment  when we play these native games

							&emsp;&emsp;The goal of having native games is to promote patriotism and to bring back our childhood days. With this, the proponents arrived with the idea of creating a modern driven native game.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;The project is prepared in response to the idea of having an interactive and exciting game that will cater Filipino native games - Larong Juan.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;The game’s challenge is to play native games from different islands in the Philippines namely: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The primary objective of this project is to create 2D flash game that comprises of the native games here in the Philippines. Pleasurable games like this can be a great aid towards learning our heritage and promoting Patriotism towards Filipino children. This project provides players of all ages, with education, mental stimulation, and entertainment.
